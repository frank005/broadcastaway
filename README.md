## 🆕 Recent Changes

### Agora Presets (ASR, LLM, TTS)
The AI agent now supports **Agora-managed presets** so you no longer need vendor API keys. Set any of the following env vars to use presets:
- `ASR_PRESET` — `deepgram_nova_2`, `deepgram_nova_3` (or leave blank for `ares`/key mode)
- `LLM_PRESET` — `openai_gpt_4o_mini`, `openai_gpt_4_1_mini`, `openai_gpt_5_nano`, `openai_gpt_5_mini`
- `TTS_PRESET` — `minimax_speech_2_6_turbo`, `minimax_speech_2_8_turbo`, `openai_tts_1`

When a preset is set, the corresponding API key (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `MICROSOFT_TTS_API_KEY`) is **not** needed. Leaving a preset blank falls back to the original env-var key mode.

Vendor-specific preset params:
- MiniMax: `TTS_MINIMAX_VOICE_ID`, `TTS_MINIMAX_SAMPLE_RATE`
- OpenAI TTS: `TTS_OPENAI_VOICE`, `TTS_OPENAI_SPEED`
- LLM: `LLM_TEMPERATURE`, `LLM_MAX_TOKENS`, `LLM_MAX_HISTORY` (apply in both preset and key mode; fall back to `OPENAI_TEMPERATURE` / `OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS` / `AI_AGENT_MAX_HISTORY` if not set)

### Agent Token
The AI Agent now joins the channel with a generated RTC+RTM token (when `AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE` is set), matching the existing client-side token flow. If no certificate is configured, the agent falls back to tokenless mode.
